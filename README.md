## Data Preparation

Data preparation is crucial for building effective machine learning models. The following steps outline how environmental data is loaded, merged, and preprocessed for model training.

### Loading and Merging Data

- **Air Quality Data**: Loaded from historical JSON files.
- **Weather Data**: Loaded from historical JSON files.
- **Merging**: DataFrames are merged on the `datetime` column to combine air quality and weather metrics.

### Cleaning and Feature Engineering

- **Missing Values**: Checked and handled to ensure data integrity.
- **Outlier Removal**: Removed using Z-score thresholding to eliminate anomalous data points.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features and targets.

### Creating Sequences for LSTM

- **Sequence Length**: 24 hours (past 24 data points) used to predict current pollution levels.
- **Input Features**: Selected weather-related metrics.
- **Target Variables**: Pollutant concentrations (SO₂, NO₂, PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, O₃, CO).

## Model Development

Leveraging time-series models, particularly LSTM networks, to predict pollution trends.

### Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Accepts sequences of past 24 hours of weather data.
- **LSTM Layers**: Three stacked LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs predictions for each pollutant.
- **Activation**: `tanh` for LSTM layers and `linear` for the output layer.

### Compilation

- **Optimizer**: Adam with varying learning rates.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## MLflow Integration

MLflow is integrated to track experiments, log metrics, and manage model versions.

### Experiment Tracking

- **Experiment Name**: `Pollution_Trend_Prediction_LSTM`
- **Parameters Logged**: Hyperparameters such as units, dropout rates, learning rates, batch sizes, epochs, etc.
- **Metrics Logged**: MSE and MAE for each pollutant and average metrics.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Utilized grid search to explore combinations of hyperparameters:

- **Units**: [128]
- **Dropout**: [0.2, 0.3]
- **Learning Rate**: [0.001, 0.0001]
- **Batch Size**: [16, 32]
- **Epochs**: [50]

### Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Calculated MSE, MAE, and R² scores for each pollutant.
- **Visualization**: Plotted actual vs. predicted pollutant concentrations.
- **Best Model Selection**: Based on lowest average MSE and MAE.

## Deployment

Deploying the best-performing model as an API ensures real-time accessibility for predictions. This section outlines the steps to set up the Flask API, integrate MLflow, incorporate Prometheus for monitoring, and run the application.

### Flask API Setup

The Flask application serves as the interface for making real-time pollution predictions based on input weather data. It integrates MLflow for model management and Prometheus for monitoring.

Key Components:

- Endpoints:
  - **/:** Main page with a form to input date and hour for prediction.
  - **/predict**: Processes prediction requests and returns results.
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetches historical weather data and actual pollution data for validation.
- **Model Inference**: Utilizes the trained LSTM model to make predictions.
- **AQI Determination**: Categorizes pollution levels into AQI ratings.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Tracks API requests, prediction times, data ingestion metrics, and prediction accuracy.

### Integrating MLflow

The Flask app leverages MLflow's Model Registry to load and manage the best-performing model.

Steps:

1. **Load Scalers and Model**:

- Feature Scaler: Standardizes input features.
- Target Scaler: Standardizes target pollutant concentrations.
- Model: Loaded from the MLflow Model Registry.

2. **Model Loading Code Snippet**:

```bash
# Load the scalers
if not os.path.exists(FEATURE_SCALER_PATH) or not os.path.exists(TARGET_SCALER_PATH):
    raise FileNotFoundError("Scaler files not found. Ensure they are present in the 'models' directory.")

feature_scaler = joblib.load(FEATURE_SCALER_PATH)
target_scaler = joblib.load(TARGET_SCALER_PATH)

# Load the local model
if not os.path.exists(MODEL_PATH):
    raise FileNotFoundError("Model directory not found. Ensure the model is saved in the 'MLModel' directory.")

try:
    model = load_model(MODEL_PATH)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model from {MODEL_PATH}: {e}")
    model = None
```

### Prometheus and Grafana Integration

Prometheus and Grafana are integrated to monitor various aspects of the application, including API requests, prediction times, data ingestion processes, and prediction accuracy.

Prometheus Metrics Defined:

- **API Metrics**:

  - app_requests_total: Total number of API requests.
  - prediction_time_seconds: Time taken to process predictions.

- **Data Ingestion Metrics**:

  - data_ingestion_total: Total number of data ingestion attempts.
  - data_ingestion_time_seconds: Time taken for data ingestion.
  - data_ingestion_volume_bytes: Size of data ingested in bytes.
  - data_ingestion_last_successful_timestamp: Timestamp of the last successful data ingestion.
  - data_ingestion_error_total: Total number of data ingestion errors.

- **Prediction Metrics**:

  - prediction*value*<pollutant>: Predicted values for each pollutant.
  - prediction*mse*<pollutant>: Mean Squared Error for predictions of each pollutant.

### Grafana Dashboards:
